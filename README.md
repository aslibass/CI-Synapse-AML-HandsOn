In this hands on series, we, as a property rental agency, are attempting
to improve our customer experience and increase the total life time
value of our customers. While we have a pretty impressive property
portfolio, and a great team supporting our organization, we want to grow
and attract new tenants. However, to do this, we need to first keep our
existing tenants, and we need to identify specific areas of improvement.
While, our tenants usually rent with an initial term of 6 or 12 months,
we want to be able to identify the tenants who are most likely to renew.
More importantly we want to identify those who wont early enough to help
us mitigate that risk, where possible. To help us we have conducted
extensive customer research through surveys, and have been quite good at
carrying out maintenance work whenever necessary. These key pieces of
information however are all in different systems and we want to use all
of it to really try and understand our tenants, and figure out where we
as the management team need to focus our attention in order to take our
wonderful organization to the next level.

Join us , as we explore the use of three powerful tools working together
to give you deeper insights into your customers, and show you patterns
that can be used by many other organizations that have customers at the
centre of what they do.

This hands on is divided into three parts.

1.  Using Dynamics 365 Customer Insights to Cleanse & Enrich a set of
    Customer Records 

2.  Using Synapse to wrangle a set of files with a Spark Cluster, host
    them in a lake database, and then make the final datasets available
    in a data warehouse.

3.  These final datasets are used with Azure Machine Learning to find
    the best predictive model for our business scenario. 

4.  Finally, this best model is used from within Customer Insights to
    create a set of golden customer records with a high level of
    insight, ready to used with a marketing engine like Dynamics 365
    Marketing.
